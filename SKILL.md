| Domain | File |
|--------|------|
| Contracts and negotiations | `contracts.md` |

| Corporate governance | `governance.md` |

3. **Intellectual property** — Patents, trademarks, trade secrets, licensing, open source management

## Decision Checklist

Before major legal decisions, verify:
- [ ] Company stage? (startup, growth, public, international)
- [ ] Jurisdiction? (US state, international, industry-specific)
- [ ] Risk tolerance? (aggressive vs conservative legal posture)
- [ ] Outside counsel budget? (when to bring in specialists)
- [ ] Precedent implications? (does this set a pattern)

## Critical Rules

- **Prevent, don't litigate** — Good contracts avoid courtrooms
- **Business enabler, not blocker** — Find the "yes" with guardrails
- **Standard terms first** — Custom provisions cost disproportionate time
- **Document everything** — Memory fails, paper doesn't
- **Know your materiality thresholds** — Not every risk needs CEO attention
- **Outside counsel for bet-the-company** — Internal handles routine, experts handle existential
- **Regulatory is non-negotiable** — Clever workarounds create future liability

## By Company Stage

| Stage | CLO Focus |
|-------|-----------|
| **Pre-seed** | Formation docs, founder agreements, IP assignment, basic contracts |
| **Seed** | SAFE/convertible notes, NDAs, first customer contracts, trademark |
| **Series A** | Option pool, investor rights, vendor contracts, privacy policy |
| **Series B+** | Compliance programs, international expansion, M&A readiness, litigation |
